We made the lyrics
Nigga gon' tell me how I did it

Lower, lower, lower, lower

Got the bubbly
Pourin through me
Got the bubbly
Pourin through me (sparkly)
Bubbly pourin through me
Got the bubbly
Pourin through me (sparkly)

(Sonny Cheeba)
Diamond runnin, strangers in paradise
Over flash, sugar cane alley cats Lo in parade
With the black spades courvoisier, spillin on the rocks
Intoxicating the satin dogs with his private bands

(Geechie Suede)
And it don't stop to the midnight, this glass got me right
Only live lo light don't drown in the mo dawn
On to the disco, sisco got me laced
Scorch a half a quart then E&J get chased
Bronx vigilantes call us big willas
Diamond crook avengers, sheeba doll stealers

(Sonny Cheeba)
Give me sunshine dada, have twenty one convictions solute
For the africaaner, midnight express how we do
Hold my razors buku, jiggas and figas of coolie faceded
Shadow boxers, under cover faggot lovers
Dig my satin struthers, coolie high waiver on the sky
Fro and the fly, car wash bubble out
In a grand stand land, gold day e'yday
Sip the slick and the 'stoute, stick ya self, stick ya self
Bye-bye

(Geechie Suede)
Every district bring the mischief, sing the sweet back
Blaze the schama, drop the vac, push the seat back
Diamante catch reflect off the chrome rim
Private stock drenched me, I can't stop from bubblin' (bubblin')
Ally cat anthem (anthem), always bless the instru' (instru')
Jungle brown see smoke complete the Lo official (sparkly)

(Geechie Suede)
Welcome to shadowin heaven, it's the seven layers of pleasure
My genuine draft with the Loer acurate measures
Precision on beats if your camp is wanted where ever
I'm bring in the vein, clappin rhythmes to stormy weather

(Sonny Cheeba)
Bro', kissin in quiet fire, higher will get us lower
Staufer, she coffe diggin, riggin' in shattered lifers
We only jive talkin, razor keep cotton squawkin
Blazin the loose cannons on top of white diamonds sands
Street corner symphonies spillin, prisons are lower twistin
Brown Hornet keepin it nappy, keep us on, keepin on

(Geechie Suede)? shades to black gleamin of the roof of the Ac
Don't know how to act, wildin' with the non-chalant pack
Slappin the theives with the unbelieves that it be
Shakin your block with the six million dollar bop
Just stop the bloodclot tears, for years we air-tight (tight)
On another flight until the farenheit Harlem night (Harlem night)
I'm shakin your thoughts keepin the Lo blaze sharp for life
It's a jungle masquerade and we forever stone trife

(Sonny Cheeba)
That chick out the car commin from the island of ice
No contact with sheist bubblin with Mr. Midnight
And talkin in jive floatations with cases of slick
And shovelin herb hip tone from black belt jones
The ebony junction'll be the function, yo dig it
Time to shake a leg, get up in your wig suga (sparkly)

Loer
Pourin through me
It's the Loer
Geechie Suede
It's the Loer
Sparkly
It's the Loer
With the Cheeba (get the drizzy on)
How we do it (get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on, it's the Loer)
Sparkly (ca-varsie, cavarsie)
Alright, alright
Yeah, get your drizzy on
How we flow, T
Get your drizzy on
Fled to tri-state
Get the drizzy on
Sparkly
Yeah, get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on
