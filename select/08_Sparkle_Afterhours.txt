Soon you'll fade away
Past the shop displays
Com'on honey
Life has just begun for you

Demons at my side
Keep me warm at night
They make sure that
I will never be alone

I can make of you
Something good to me
I can think that what happened made us free
But I can't lie about you- to you

We fed upon our flesh
And bled till we confessed
'Cause the pain is freedom
And your pain is you

You without your tears
You without the rules
Com'on people let's bribe our evil too
'Cause I won't lie 'bout you- to you

People fade away
Past the shop displays
Walk on honey
Life has just begun for you
For you
You
You
