Sun is up and greets with a grin,
Let me know, that I was in,
Go outside with a smile on my face,
Jump in my car and leave this place,
I heard, all the news,
There is no offer, that I wouldn't refuse,
Now come time, for me to run,
Sorry people, but i'm not the one,
So I think I have to split a match and think about it,
I'm on the run for fun don't have to shout it,
Just like a? on the saturdays around it,
Try callin' when you think that you found it,

Enjoyin' all the sides throughout the ride,
Led my cheer be my guide,
I'm seventy in, i wanna ride up the city,
Some cristall clain here and I swear it's a pitty
City sparkle, flashin' twilight,
Just like a big daydream, in the middle of night,
Smooth jump and fun, as I heared of town,
Gone sirk in the night
I said next time I take time to peace me to down,

Arrivin' at my destination,
Never know where is all frustrations,
Cool as I want, in a easy chair,
Happy just to know, that I'm gonna be there,
Yeah,
