(Making me sparkle)
I got this feeling
It's making me sparkle
Can you feel it
I can feel it
It's all around me

Let's do this together
Tonight, with you

Where'd you come from I've never found this ever
Is this only for one night and I'll never see you again
And I've got to live this up right now

Let's do this (yeah)
